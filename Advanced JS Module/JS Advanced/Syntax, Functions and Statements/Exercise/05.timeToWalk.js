function timeToWalk(steps, footprint, speed) {
    /*\How to solve the problem instructions:
    - We find the distance in meters by multiplying the steps with the footprint;
    - Transform the speed into m/s by diving the speed by 3.6;
    - Then find the time;
    - You should find the time in minutes, then in seconds and in hours;
    - Pay attention what happens when minutes are more than 60;
    - And format the results in such a way to be double digits;
